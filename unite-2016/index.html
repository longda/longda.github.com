    <h1 class="h2">Unite 2016 Los Angeles</h1>
    <h2 class="h3"></h2>

    <h2 class="h3"></h2>
    <p>
      Recently I had the good fortune of attending <a href="https://unite.unity.com/2016/los-angeles">Unite 2016</a> in sunny Los Angeles at the Loews Hollywood hotel.  There were three days of talks, tutorials, and technical sessions from November 1 - 3 with a hands-on training day on October 31.  I even accidentally stumbled upon the source code viewing area while trying to find the training room so that would have been another option for Day 0 on the conference schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the technical presentations took place in the Dolby Theater, indie game developers gave demos and vendors pitched their tech over in the hotel conference rooms.  As usual, there was an Ask the Experts area where you could get a second set of eyes on your nastiest questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the week, there were also a number networking events in addition to the technology sessions.  Day 1 ended with a big cocktail reception and awards ceremony upstairs at Hollywood and Highland.  For Day 2 we wrapped up with a trip to our own <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Unite16%20universal">private section of Universal Studios</a> for rides and goodies.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h3"></h2>
    <p>
      Unity has been kind enough to upload the entire set of presentations from the conference, including the keynote, to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0Qe9siEr8armEqOnt5XKIe6">massive youtube playlist</a> with 80 videos!  If you can’t afford the conference, this is the next best thing and it’s free!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://unite.unity.com/archive/2009">Unite is easily my favorite conference</a> and I highly recommend taking the trip if it makes a stop near you.  Many of the talks are highly technical and provide key insights from people making extremely high quality games and interactive experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was really difficult to narrow down the list, these are three presentations I attended and found valuable.

    <h2 class="h3">Let's Talk (Content) Optimization</h2>
    <p>
      In this highly technical session, Ian from Unity outlined optimization techniques through examples of real-world performance problems and potential solutions to common pitfalls related to content.  He went over low level serialization details in the engine, how to create simple load test code, and reported his performance data for the various techniques.

    <h2 class="h3">Tools, Tricks and Technologies for Reaching Stutter Free 60 FPS in INSIDE</h2>
    <p>
      This enlightening technical talk by some of the people from <a href="http://www.playdead.com/">Playdead</a>  turned out to be three super dense talks packed into one.  First, Kristian covered the details of how the world of <a href="http://www.playdead.com/games/inside/">INSIDE</a> is continually streamed without frame rate stuttering issues.  Next, Erik talk about automation and profiling tools the team built and used throughout the development process.  Last, Søren demonstrates 10 steps to get a 10x performance increase from your scripts.
