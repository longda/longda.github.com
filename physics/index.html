    <h4 class="h5">General Fact:</h4>
    <section>
      If the hypotenuse of a right triangle is c, then the length of the side opposite one of the acute angles, theta, is c * sin(theta) and the length of the side adjacent to this angle is c * cos(theta).

    <h2 class="h3">Newton's Laws</h2>
    <h3 class="h4">First Law</h3>
    <section>
      Newton's first law, sometimes referred to as the law of intertia, states that if the net force acting on an object is zero, then the velocity of the object is constant.
    </section>

    <h3 class="h4">Second Law</h3>
    <section>
      Newton's second law defines a force and relates an object's acceleration to its mass.
    </section>
    <section>
      <p class="h4">
      $$F_{net} = {ma}$$
      <p>
    </section>

    <h3 class="h4">Third Law</h3>
    <section>
      Newton's third law says that if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts a force back on object A in the opposite direction but in equal strength.
    </section>

    <section>
      <p class="h4">
      $$F_A = {-F_B}$$

    <h3 class="h4">Newton's Law of Gravitation <a class="h5" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">[more]</a></h3>
    <section>
      Sometimes known as the law of universal gravitation, this law states that any two bodies in the universe attract each other with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
    </section>
    <section>
      <p class="h4">
        $$F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p class="h4">
        $$G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} N \centerdot m^2/kg^2$$
      </p>
    </section>

    <h3 class="h4">Gravitational Attraction Due to an Extended Body</h3>
    <h4 class="h5">Example:</h4>
    <section>
      The Sun has a mass of $$2 \times 10^{30}$$ and Mars has a mass of $$6 \times 10^{23}$$
    </section>
    <section>
      How does the acceleration of the Sun due to Mars compare to the acceleration of Mars due to the Sun?
    </section>
    <section>
      $$ m_S a_S = m_M a_M \Rightarrow \frac{a_S}{a_M} = \frac{m_M}{m_S} = \frac{6 \times 10^{23} kg}{2 \times 10^{30} kg} = 3 \times 10^{-7} $$
    </section>
    <section>
      This means that the acceleration of the Sun is significantly smaller than that of Mars (0.0000003).  Due to its smaller mass, Mars will be affected more by the gravitational force which helps explain why Mars orbits the Sun.
    </section>

    <h3 class="h4">Weight</h3>
    <section>
      The weight of an object (not to be confused with its mass) is the gravitational force exerted on it by the planet/moon/body it is on.
    </section>
    <section>

        $$ F_W = m g $$

    <h3 class="h4">The Normal Force <a class="h5" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_force">[more]</a></h3>
    <section>
      The perpendicular component of a surface contact force exerted on an object.
    </section>

    <h3 class="h4">Friction <a class="h5" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Coefficient_of_friction">[more]</a></h3>
    <section>
      Static friction is between two or more solid objects that are not moving relative to each other, while kinetic friction is between two or more objects moving relative to each other and rubbing together.  The direction of static friction is opposite of the intended motion, while kinetic friction is opposite to the motion/sliding.
    </section>
    <section>
      <p class="h4">
        $$ F_{static-friction, max} = \mu_s F_N $$
      </p>
      <p class="h4">
        $$ F_{kinetic-friction} = \mu_k F_N $$
      </p>
    </section>

    <h3 class="h4">Pulleys</h3>
    <section>
      For two single masses, <em>m<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>m<sub>2</sub></em>, attached to a pulley and cord, the downward forces are due to weight (mass x gravity) and the upward forces are due to tension.  The resulting forces would be <em>T</em>, <em>m<sub>1</sub>g</em>, and <em>m<sub>2</sub>g</em>.
    </section>

    <h3 class="h4">Ramps</h3>
    <section>
      <p>
        If an object of mass <em>m</em> is on a ramp (inclined plane), then the force of gravity on the object <em>mg</em> has two components.
      </p>
      <p>
        One parallel to the ramp: $$ m g \sin(\theta) $$ and one normal to the ramp: $$ m g \cos(\theta) $$
