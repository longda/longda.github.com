      <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/rules/">Ludum Dare</a> is a game jam where developers from around the world spend a weekend creating games based on a theme suggested by the LD community.  The jam is designed for everyone and take place over 72 hours starting Friday evening and commencing the following Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entrants can use any tools, libraries, base code, or art however it is asked you opt-out of the graphics and audio categories if youâ€™re using those types assets which were already made prior to the competition.  There is also a Compo version which has much stricter rules, sort of like a hardcore mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/">Ludum Dare 37</a> took place December 9th through December 11th, 2016 and the theme was One Room.

    <h2 class="h3">Zombie Horde Mode</h2>
    <p>
      For this entry, I wanted to make a simple top down shooter in a single space with waves of enemies continually spawning until the player was eventually overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a  scoring mechanism, each enemy killed would contribute one point and the user would start with five hearts constituting successful enemy attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the player completes each wave, a new weapon replaces the current, much like a Gun Game in Call of Duty.

    <!-- <p>
      As part of an exploration into game development patterns and techniques with Unity3D, I built out a basic demo of an object pool that I could try out on my laptop and phone.
    </p>


    <p>
      Implementing a basic object pool is fairly simple.  One way is to define a reference in your class for the pool this object belongs to.
